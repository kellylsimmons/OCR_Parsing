# OCR_Parsing
I was unclear if I was allowed to used Jupyter Notebooks to implement the solution to the problem,  hence I built two different solutions to this problem, my perfered file is the BusinessCardParser.ipnyb.  However, if this file is not acceptable please use BusinessCardParser.py.    
## BusinessCardParser.ipnyb (Prefered Method)
  
  Jupyter notebooks are a browser based interactive coding platform.  To utlize the software download the Anaconda Data Science Platform here https://www.anaconda.com/distribution/.  Once loaded you can launch a web browser from the commnd line with the comand:
 > jupyter notebooks
  
# BusinessCardParser.py

BusinessCardParser is designed to be run the command line on a computer with Python version 3.4 or higher installed.  To run the program simply navigate to the correct folder and run the following from the command line.

>  python BusinessCardParser.py

Once the program loads you will be prompted to input the OCR results ONE LINE AT A TIME.  Simply input the text and press enter.  When you have entered all lines from the results, press enter without inputing text, and the results will print to the console.
