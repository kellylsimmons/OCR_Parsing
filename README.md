# OCR_Parsing
I was unclear if I was allowed to used Jupyter Notebooks to implement the solution to the problem,  hence I built two different solutions to this problem, my perfered file is the BusinessCardParser.ipnyb.  However, if this file is not acceptable please use BusinessCardParser.py.    
## BusinessCardParser.ipnyb (Prefered Method)
  
  Jupyter notebooks are a browser based interactive coding platform.  To utlize the software download the Anaconda Data Science Platform here https://www.anaconda.com/distribution/
